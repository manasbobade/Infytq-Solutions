Q2 of 2
Assume that a dictionary has data in the form of { key1:value1, key2:value2â€¦}

my_library =
{
    103 : "Alice in Wonderland",
    104 : "The Turning Point",
    113 : "Wings on Fire",
    134 : "Harry Potter"
}
What do you think my_library[104] would point to ?

104
This is a dictionary and not a list, you cant do that!
