Q2 of 6
Assume that there are five variables with the values given below: 

num1=10
num2=5 
num3=0 
num4=2 
num5=10 

(num1==num5) and ((num2-num4*num3) == (num2-num3))


Which among the expressions provide the same result as the
above expression?

Option not(num3>=num4) and (num5/num2 == num4) is Correct




\Q3 of 6
What is the output of the below code snippet?

num1 = 10
num2 = 5
num2 *= num1
print(num2)
This is same as num2=num2*num1. Python allows you to do this kind of short circuiting with any arithmetic operator

50
10
25
100
Option 50 is Correct



Q4 of 6
What is the output of the below code snippet?

num1 = 50
num2 = 2
num3 = 3
num4 = 8
result = num1/num4-num3*num2+num4
print(result)
 

100
14.5
8.25
-23.75
Option 8.25 is Correct
